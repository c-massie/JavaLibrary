/**
 * <p>Generic event for calling arbitrary listeners.</p>
 *
 * <p>Events may be exposed as fields. Events should generally always be final, as each Event object represents
 * something happening to that object and isn't expected to be re√§ssigned. Note that exposing implementations of
 * InvokableEvent will allow it to be invoked from code accessing the object as part of the public interface.
 * Public-facing events should be non-invokable implementations of Event. (such as {@link ProtectedEvent} or
 * {@link ProtectedPriorityEvent})</p>
 *
 * <p>Example: {@code private final InvokableEvent<ThingHappenedEventArgs> thingHappened_internal = new SetEvent<>();}</p>
 * <p>Example: {@code public final Event<ThingHappenedEventArgs> thingHappened = new ProtectedEvent(thingHappened_internal)}</p>
 * @param <TArgs> The type of the event args objects passed to listeners of this event.
